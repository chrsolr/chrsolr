# From VS Code to Neovim: My Journey  

## Early Editor Days  
My journey to Neovim is probably not all that different from many other programmers’. Over the past 13 years as a developer (8 of them professional), I’ve experimented with a wide range of IDEs and text editors.  

Back in college, I lived inside IntelliJ, Eclipse, and NetBeans. Once I started working as a web developer, I switched between Visual Studio, VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and others.  

For a long time, VS Code felt like home. But everything changed when I discovered Neovim—thanks to ThePrimeagen and TJ DeVries. For the first time, I truly felt *at home*.  

Maybe it’s the simplicity. Maybe it’s just what happens when you get older—or have kids. Either way, Neovim clicked for me.

## Growing Up, Learning to Learn  
I’m from Puerto Rico and grew up in the Bronx, New York, during the '90s. Yeah, I’m old AF. But growing up in NYC as a non-English speaker taught me the most important skill of my life: how to teach myself.  

That mindset got me through my GED, college, and ultimately my career as a programmer.  

When I started with my current employer, I transitioned from C# to JavaScript. That’s when I began looking for a replacement for Visual Studio. Sublime Text felt too minimal. Atom and WebStorm didn’t stick. I eventually settled on VS Code, mostly because the other web developer at the company was using it too.

## First Encounter with Vim  
As the years went by and the team grew, a Neovim user joined the company. That was actually the first time I ever heard of Vim.  

I didn’t switch right away—in fact, it took a few years. I used to joke around with him about it, not realizing he was onto something the whole time.  

A few years later, after that coworker had moved on, I came across Theo and ThePrimeagen. Watching ThePrimeagen fly through code and hearing him talk about the importance of investing in your workflow—since it’s something you do almost every day—really piqued my interest.

## Dipping My Toes into Vim Motions  
That’s when I decided to give it a try. I started by installing Vim motion plugins for WebStorm and VS Code.  

I made a rule for myself: if I didn’t know how to do something, I had to look it up—no disabling the plugins, no exceptions.  

Another big step was learning how to touch type. At the time, my typing speed was about 20–30 WPM. Adding Vim motions dropped me to 5 WPM. It was frustrating, but I stuck with it.  

After about a week, I was back to my normal typing speed. But something had changed—I felt *joy*. I actually wanted to work more, just so I could keep coding. It was like rekindling my love for programming.

## Why I Left VS Code Behind  
Still, I felt limited.  

I was stuck navigating VS Code with the mouse, juggling multiple instances to work across different services (damn microservices). On top of that, I had to keep a terminal open here and there for Kubernetes and other tooling. It all felt disconnected.  

That’s when I finally decided to give Neovim a real shot.

## My Neovim Struggles  
I started with **kickstart.nvim** after watching a TeeJ video.  

At first, it was rough. ESLint and Prettier wouldn’t work. File navigation felt clunky. I hated `which-key`. Nothing made sense, and I didn’t understand half the plugins. It was overwhelming—and honestly, a bit discouraging.  

While searching for guidance, I stumbled across **LazyVim** and the concept of Neovim “distros.” I also tried **NvChad**. Diving into those kept me curious and engaged with the ecosystem.  

Eventually, I returned to kickstart.nvim and rewrote my config line by line. Even if I didn’t fully understand something, I made sure to figure out how it affected my setup. That hands-on approach finally helped me grasp LSP, keybindings, and Vim options.

## The Point of No Return  
I stuck with my custom kickstart config for months.  

At one point, I watched Melky’s video about transitioning from Neovim to VS Code and decided to give VS Code another chance.  

But this time, VS Code felt… slow. Especially compared to Neovim + tmux, which had become my daily driver.  

After three days, I was back in Neovim—and it felt like coming home.

## Why Neovim Stuck  
Thanks to switching to Neovim, I not only became more productive, but also discovered amazing tools like tmux, Yabai, and Aerospace. The whole ecosystem changed the way I work.  

Neovim isn’t for everyone, at least not right away. But if you value control, learning, and speed… give it time. It might just change how you feel about coding.

### Closing Thought  
For me, Neovim isn’t just an editor—it’s a mindset shift. It taught me that investing in my tools is really investing in myself.
